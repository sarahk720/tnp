<h1>Aim Trainer</h1>
  <h2>People</h2>
    <h3>Jackson - Designing and assisting with drills

        Jessica - Creating Unity Drills

        Kaylyn - Designing and assisting with drills

        Sarah - Creating UI</h3>
  
  <h2>Aims</h2>
    <h3> Improve the users reaction time, accuracy, and aim stability. Allow the user to have a gradual increase in performance</h3>
  <h2>Goals</h2>
    <h3>to complete a trial version, allowing us to test the prototype before making it a finished product. Include 3 different types of training situations</h3>
  <h2>Scope</h2>
    <h3>Aspects we wish to implement
    A few training scenarios allowing the player to practice different scenarios.
    Scenarios will include focusing on basic aiming and shooting, moving targets as well as first-person movement, maps and different situations.
    Options and settings that will allow the player to change volume as well as sensitivity.</h3>
  <h2>Limits</h2>
    <h3>Time allocated for the development of our project.
    Only one gun.
    Minimal to no ability to change field of scope, control change, amongst other things.
    Map design and graphics will be simple.</h3>
  
  <h2>Tools & Technology</h2>
    <h3>Kaylyn, Jackson & Sarah are all using Windows, Jessica with macOS.
    Our diversity of our systems allow us to test multiple environments, meaning we can test our game without the need for external help.
    Unity is the chosen software being used to development of our game, some members have experience with using it but not enough for it to be notable.</h3>
  
  <h2>Plan and current outcomes</h2>
    <h3>Despite having its ups and downs, our end goals have not changed. We aim to create an aim trainer with 2-3 aiming scenarios. 
        As a team we never set any solid roles, but still maintained frequent and regular communication as well as splitting the work up well. 
        The process would've been smoother had we been more experienced in Unity, however our progress relative to our timetable has been solid. 
        Our biggest roadblocks were: our most experienced member leaving, and spending time to understand Unity. 
        No changes need to be made to our timetable, and we will be able to finish on track with our schedule.

  <h2>Current Challenges</h2>
    <h3>As essentially first time Unity users, our group came across a lot of bugs. 
        These bugs were fairly troublesome in the sense that we had to troubleshoot them with very little Unity experience.
        The main bugs we experienced were coding errors, random errors when Unity was restarted and some save issues.
        As well as coding errors, a major setback we experienced was our 5th member, Jai, leaving the group. 
        Jai was by far the most experienced Unity user in the group and his departure was extremely abrupt.
        To combat this we reassigned roles and filled the gaps, and created a new plan.
        A challenge we experienced in the beginning was our lack of communication. Each member started off fairly shy.
        Despite this, we became more familiar with one another and our communication improved lots.</h3>
  
  <h2>Team Reflections</h2>
    <h3>Overall our team has made steady progress with different aspects of the game. 
        Whether it be the camera movement or basic UI, each of us was able to contribute in building part of the game and each of us has taken this as a form of new experience. 
        We have faced many challenges and still are, but slowly over the semester we have grown to overcome these hurdles and help each other in trying to build the aim trainer. 
        Some advice we'd give to other groups embarking on a similar project is:
        - Get to know each other well early on, so that everyone is more comfortable and ideas can be discussed freely.
        - Make sure you have a concrete idea and assign roles fairly early on in the project. This will make progressing easier and smoother.
        - Be quick to familiarise yourself with the tools you'll need, as this takes up a fair portion of your time and is essential.
        - Communication is key. Constantly update each other on the progress you make and set goals each week to achieve and realise your progress.</h2>
